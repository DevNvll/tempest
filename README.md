# Tempest Files

Open source Cloud File storage SaaS. Made with fullstack node, nextjs and tailwind.

This project was created with the purpose of learning new tecnologies and best practices and how to apply them in real world projects, so the usage of "too-overkill-for-this-project" tecnologies such as Terraform is on purpose.
